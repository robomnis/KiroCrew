"""Shared channel turn pipeline — one copy of the dispatch skeleton.

This module owns the sequence every non-Slack channel dispatcher runs around
:class:`TurnDriver`:

    governance gate
    -> renderer.on_turn_start()          (typing indicator before cold start)
    -> sessions.get_or_create + set_channel
    -> publish_turn_identity
    -> ctx_builder.build_message         (off-loop, embeds block)
    -> TurnDriver.run                    (shared redaction + approval ladder)
    -> post-turn: record_success, persist, threshold notice, SEL audit
                                         (each guarded independently)
    -> finally: renderer.close() + release (release gated on acquire)

What stays per-channel is what actually differs between them: the wire
protocol, event normalization, ``authorize()`` semantics, rendering, command
vocabulary, and the ack strings. Channels inject those through
:class:`ChannelTurn` rather than subclassing, so a capability this protocol
lacks widens the protocol once instead of forking the pipeline.

Dependency direction is ``<channel> -> messaging`` (never the reverse), so this
module must not import any channel package.
