"""Weixin command parsing.

The vocabulary is DATA — :data:`COMMAND_SPEC` — and both the matcher and the
`/help` card read it, so a command cannot be added without appearing in help.

Per-conversation generation + awaiting-compact state lives in the shared
``messaging.conversation.ConversationState`` (re-exported so callers can import
it from this module, mirroring ``wecom.commands``).
