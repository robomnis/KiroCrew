// Auto Triage Pipeline — a small, SELF-CONTAINED typed client for the one seam
// this app reads: Issue Radar's crew-fabric endpoint. The data half of the
// feature (recording `phase` on the ledger line, `fold_fabric`, the route) lives
// in the `issue_radar` builtin and is repo-agnostic; this app is its first
// tenant, so it reads THROUGH that seam rather than owning a backend of its own.
//
//   GET /api/apps/issue-radar/crew/fabric?owner=&repo=[&provider=&host=]
//
// The base path is issue-radar's, matching every builtin's `/api/apps/<name>`
// convention. Nothing here imports from `../issue-radar/*`: the types below are
// this app's own copy, so the two apps can evolve their frontends independently
// (wave 2 builds the faithful drawing and the queue dashboard on top of these).
//
// FORWARD-TOLERANT, like the seam it reads. `crewFabric()` never throws on a repo
// with no fabric: a 404 (issue-radar disabled / route absent), 500, 403 (repo not
// connected), a non-JSON body, or a payload from a newer schema all collapse to
// the same normalized empty result, and the view renders its designed empty
// state. The EMPTY case is the COMMON one — most installs never ran a crew.
